# Tips for Code Submission

Below is an example code submission for three easy questions: add, subtract and multiply.

```
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b

def multiply(a, b):
    return a * b
```

### Tip 1: Remove the Import Statements
Due to the requirement of the sandbox environment for running the tests, all import statements will be considered an invalid input. That being said, all commonly used packages like `numpy`, `math`, and `collections` have already been imported in the running environment so you could still use them without writing the import statements.

### Tip 2: Online Editor Cache
If you are using the online code editor for submission, all your code will be cached even if it has not been submitted yet.
